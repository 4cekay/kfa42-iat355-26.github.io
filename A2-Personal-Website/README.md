This website is KC Fedellaga's (#301535962/kfa42@sfu.ca) personal webpage made for the Spring 2026 semester of IAT355.
It is (and continues to be) constructed using a developing understanding of HTML, CSS, and (newly!) JavaScript.

The site can be navigated by clicking any of the underlined headings/section titles in the header tab, which will scroll directly down to the selected section.
Otherwise, users may scroll down at their leisure, perusing and evaluating KC's work as they go.

There is currently one hyperlink connecting to a separate page for showcasing visualizations made in IAT355, and mailto links for contacting at the bottom section.

The page is also responsive and _should_ be able to minimize to the user's window size preferences.

Thank you!
